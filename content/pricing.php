        <h1> PRICING INFORMATION </h1>

        <h2>Events</h2>
<p>Our event photography services are $200 an hour and include weddings, birthdays, concerts, outdoor sports and corporate events. You receive 10 to 20 printed physical photos as a preview as well as a flash drive containing from 100 to 200 photos depending on the number of hours. We will send you the printed copies within 10 days of the event and the final flash drive will be sent within six to eight weeks. A lot of the time it takes less time to finalize the photos than we allot so we will contact you to tell you when they are ready and an appointment can be made to pick them up and discuss some of our decisions in making them or you can request to have them sent or dropped off at your venue or venue address. </p>

        <h2>Portraits</h2>
<p>Our portraits can be taken in any local location you would like. We have a set and other props ready for use, however, we can travel if preferred whether it be to your house, a local park or a place that gives us permission to photograph at. We will need a weekâ€™s notice if you wish to have your portraits taken in a place outside of our studio so that we can go through the proper steps in order to ensure that you can have you pictures taken in the place that suits you. It will also cost an extra flat rate of $25 if you wish to travel out of a 10 mile radius around our studio. Portraits are $50 an hour and normally take less than two hours. We will send you 5 to 10 pictures as a preview and you will receive them a week after your schedule appointment. A flash drive of 50 images will be sent you four to six weeks after and we will contact you to determine whether you want them sent to you or if you would like to pick them up. </p>

        <h2>Landscape Images</h2>
<p>For landscape images, we take photos of nature and horizons and similar areas and have them displayed in our studio. There you can view them and purchase them. Most photos are priced individually due to image quality, location, size and photographer. The price of the photos ranges from $15 to $80 as the descriptions, (size, image quality etc.) stated before can vary quite a bit. </p>

        <h2>Travel Photography</h2>
<p>Our travel photography is similar to landscape images. We have photographers that travel around the globe who send us images that they take and finalize. These images are also on sale and exhibited around our studio. They generally cost from $25 to $100 because of their location and their exquisite quality. </p>

        <h2>How to Contact Us</h2>

All appointments must be made 2 weeks in advance and a month in advance during the holiday season, which is from December 1st through January 15th.
